This site is broken into sections for different API information:

* Vehicles - API commands to communicate between your vehicle and your client.
* Codes - Localized Tesla vehicle option codes for the [Model S](codes/model-s-options.md) and [Model X](codes/model-x-options.md)

## What Tesla products are supported?

* Tesla Model S
* Tesla Model 3

## What is teslaapi.io?

This is a community of developers who are reverse engineering Tesla's API.

## What are the client\_id and client\_secret values?

Authentication to the Tesla API is done through OAuth. These values were retrieved from somebody's OAuth session and are now being used for API access.

## Is this API official?

Absolutely not. These endpoints are a result of reverse engineering Tesla's mobile applications and vehicle software.
